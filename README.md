# Data-Analysis - Halal-Restaurants in HK Google Sheets / Excel
## Project Description: Analysis of Halal Restaurants in Hong Kong

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Halal restaurants in Hong Kong using Google Sheets and Excel. The process involved several key steps:

1. **Data Importing**: Collected data from various sources, including online directories and review platforms, and imported it into Google Sheets/Excel for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Ensured data accuracy and consistency by removing duplicates, correcting errors, and standardizing formats. This step was crucial for reliable analysis.

3. **Data Tabulation**: Organized the cleaned data into structured tables, allowing for easier manipulation and analysis. This included categorizing restaurants by cuisine, location, and rating.

4. **Data Visualization**: Utilized built-in visualization tools in Google Sheets and Excel to create charts and graphs. This helped in effectively presenting key insights, such as the distribution of Halal restaurants by area and popular cuisines.

The result was a clear and informative analysis that provided valuable insights into the Halal dining landscape in Hong Kong, supporting further research and decision-making for both consumers and restaurant owners.
